<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<h2> Sewing</h2>

<p> One hobby I have is sewing. 
I learned how to sew when I was 10 when my aunt came over to fix her pants. 
She showed me how to sew by hand by cutting out a piece of my doll's dress and letting me sew it back together. 
A few months after that my mom bought me a toy sewing machine, but we couldn't get it to work right 
so I went to my grandma's house and she gave me one of her sewing machines to have.
This is how I got really interested in sewing. </p>

<p> After I got pretty good at sewing I started to make clothes for my doll. 
The first thing I made for her was a really simple skirt. 
It wasn't really that good, but I was happy. 
Then, I made a cloth doll. It took me a few days to make her, but I was happy once I was done. 
It was far from perfect, but I was really proud and so was my mom. 
Recently, I made a suspender skirt for my doll and one for myself.
These are some things I’ve made.

<h3> Drawing</h3>

<p> Another hobby I have is drawing. 
I always liked to draw, but I didn't really do it as much or was as good as I am now. 
I started getting very intersted in being a good drawer in 8th grade art class.
I always took very long on my drawings because I wanted to get 100, but all that time I spent got me very interested in it.
I started drawing a lot more at home in my free time and after a while my art started to look really good and I loved it.
This is how I got intrested in drawing.
</p>

<p> After my drawings started getting really good I started drawing more and more. 
I drew myself for art class and it looked nice.
I also drew the "Stary Night" and it took me a very long time, but it came out amazing.
Now since I got a lot better I started trying to draw cartoons of real people instead of just regular cartoons.
These were two of my favorite hobbies and how I got interested in them.
